How our Bonding Curve Works:
=============================

***General idea***
When each bonding curve is created, 752 million tokens out of 1 billion are available for purchase before the token "completes its bonding curve".  

At the start of the bonding curve, 28 solana worth of virtual reserve is added, along with the 752 million tokens, creating a starting market cap of around 4000$.  

When a token completes its bonding curve, the 70% of the remaining 248 million tokens(about 173 million tokens) and 79 solana are sent to a pool on radium. The remaining 30% are burnt.  

***Important notes***:
A token reaches bonding when its total reserves reach 113 sol(85 real reserves + 28 virtual reserves).  
Virtual reserves provide a starting value for the token, allowing it to be traded without initial liquidity.
